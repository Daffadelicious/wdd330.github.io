        <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <h3>'use strict'</h3>
        <p>'use strict' gives us more errors. It can help us to avoid using bad practice early on in our project so that
            even if that code would work there, it won't cause issues in the future. Strict is encouraged in basically
            every javascript project, there's no downside to having more help in debugging. <span>IMPORTANT: 'use
                strict' MUST be the first line of a javascript file in order for it to work.</span></p>
        <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
        <p>Helps with syntax errors, indentation, and pointing out bad practice. Another huge benefit is it can act as a
            style guide, keeping a team working within the same conventions</p>
        <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
        <p>Essentially an if statment that checks to see if user is up to date or if API or other feature actually
            exists.
            Ensures we can give a custom error message or provide an alternative instead of giving the user a scary
            error.</p>
        <h3>Debugging in the Browser and Debuggers</h3>
        <p>My favorite, and my expertise! All the fun stuff, you've got alert() and console.log() which are the easiest
            in my opinion. Most proper browsers can debug now including Firefox, Edge, Chrome, and Safari. I also like
            using the debugger tool in VS code.</p>
        <h3>Error Objects</h3>
        <p>Great way to help correct errors on the user's part or to debug. You can declare specific messages for all
            sorts of errors (ex: EvalError, RangeError, SyntaxError, etc). It's always easier to solve an error if you
            know exactly what's causing it.</p>
        <h3>Throwing Exceptions</h3>
        <p>Basically an exit, great for shoving an important problem in our face so that the error can be solved before
            moving onto the next lines of code. Great way to debug line by line instead of stumbling across a giant
            tangled ball of mess later on that you'd have to pick apart. </p>
        <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
        <p>This is similar to throwing exceptions but code continue in the background and errors can be handed around in
            the background as opposed to in the user's face. This can allow for discrete fixes and keeps things moving
            for the user instead of having everything break over a very small or simple error. Not as great for initial
            debugging but better for once a site is out and functioning.</p>
        <h3>Testing and Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Self explanitory, test individual functions or snippets of codes to ensure they work before adding them to a
            huge project. Testing frameworks help us write tests, a popular one is Jest. There's a development style centered around this: TTD. The steps it follows are: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Write tests (should initially fail)</li>
                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                <li>Test refactured code</li>
                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
            </ol>
